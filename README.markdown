Settings
========

A special hash for application-wide settings.

Description
-----------

Small and simple specialized Hash which is helpful for storing immutable,
required key/value pairs to be loaded from a YAML file.

New instances of `SettingsHash` are readonly -- any attempt to write to the
Hash after initialization will fail with a `TypeError`.

Any attempt to read a key which is not set will raise a 
`SettingsHash::SettingNotFound` error.

`SettingsHash` supports an optional namespace which can be used to define
multiple groups of settings within a single .yml file. For example, "test" and
"development" might be different namespaces for different running environments.

Usage
-----

### General

    settings = SettingsHash.new('path/to/settings.yml')
    settings = SettingsHash.new('path/to/settings.yml', 'foo') => loads settings under the 'foo' namespace
    
### Rails

Put your environment-specific `settings.yml` in `config/settings.yml`. It may
look something like this:

    development:
      memcached: true
    test:
      memcached: false
      
This file will automatically be loaded into a `Settings` global which can be
accessed like a normal Hash:

    Settings[:memcached] => true (development environment)
    Settings[:memcached] => false (test environment)
